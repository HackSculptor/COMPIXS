now i came to conclusion that according to company type and product type we defined a structure of public that handles the company 

hence first know which type of company your are going to work on 

#### PRODUCT BASED COMPANY

1) if company is  Product-Based Companies

--->developing, manufacturing, and selling physical or digital products.

ROLES

##### BOARD OF DIRECTOR
user,one main long-term visioner

##### CEO

1) overall strategy maker 

2) vision creator , overlooks the vision above him 

3) create strategy according to that 

4) for each particular strategy 

secures funding by users,approvals of users,allocages them to that c-suites

5) builds a team according to strategy from that strategy or reassign task if strategy is not starting based cause strategy can be defined as two types one is intask and second is newtask

6) team building working

  he CEO meets with the CTO, CFO (and possibly CMO/COO, if applicable) to share the strategic vision and desired organizational structure.

##### CTO,CFO,etc

 Analyzes financial needs related to the product launch (budgeting, pricing strategy, funding requirements).
• Determines the senior finance leads needed (e.g., accounting manager, financial planning lead, cost-control supervisor).
• Proposes a financial team structure to support the product’s economic viability.

##### Senior Leads assemble teams 

 The CTO then holds sessions with senior tech leads, who each form their own small teams focused on design, engineering, and user testing.

 the CFO meets with senior finance leads who assemble a lean financial unit to manage funding, cost control, and pricing strategies.

 The CEO, through regular strategic meetings, reviews progress, makes necessary adjustments, and ensures that all teams are working in tandem to launch the jackfruit product successfully.


 ##### ROLES 

1) board of directive( you , long term visioner )
2) CEO ( see vision decides strategies and gives all info to directors)
3) CFO,CTO,etc (work under CEO and helps in team building according to strategy or what new strategies gonna fit with particular existing team and reports to CEO if any misplaces accd to how a product should created by pretuned model and if someone not works well he restart them)

2. Key Simulation Metrics
To create an engaging business simulation, you’ll need to define and track various metrics that reflect the health of the company. Here are some key metrics:

Financial Metrics
Daily Revenue:
• Total income generated from product sales each day.

Profit Margins:
• Measure of profitability after deducting production and operating costs.

Balance Sheets:
• Snapshot of assets, liabilities, and equity to track financial health.

Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):
• Direct costs attributable to the production of the jackfruit product.

Operating Expenses:
• Daily/weekly expenses such as salaries, rent, marketing costs, and logistics.

Cash Flow:
• Monitoring inflows and outflows to ensure sufficient liquidity for operations and growth.

Operational Metrics
Production Volume:
• Number of jackfruit product units manufactured per day/week.

Quality Control Pass Rate:
• Percentage of products meeting quality standards.

Supply Chain Efficiency:
• Metrics like lead times, inventory turnover, and defect rates.

Team Performance & Productivity:
• Internal KPIs for different teams (e.g., engineering productivity, sales conversion rates).

Market & Customer Metrics
Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):
• Expense incurred to acquire a new customer.

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):
• Predicted revenue a customer generates over their relationship with the company.

Market Share:
• Company's share within the jackfruit product market relative to competitors.

Customer Satisfaction (NPS or CSAT):
• Feedback scores that indicate how well the product and services meet customer needs.

Growth & Innovation Metrics
R&D Cycle Time:
• Time taken from product ideation to launch.

New Product Iterations:
• Frequency and success rate of product updates or new variants.

Employee Turnover & Engagement:
• Metrics to gauge team stability and satisfaction, which impact long-term innovation and performance.

How It All Fits Together in Your Simulation
NPC Behavior:
Each NPC (e.g., CEO, CFO, CTO) uses their defined responsibilities to make strategic decisions that affect these metrics. For instance, the CFO might adjust pricing strategy based on daily revenue trends, while the CTO ensures the production process keeps up with quality benchmarks.

Decision Flow:
The CEO communicates the vision and strategy, then the C-suite (CTO, CFO, etc.) refines this into actionable plans. Their teams, built from senior to frontline levels, execute these plans. Changes or adjustments in one area (like a drop in quality control pass rates) can trigger strategic shifts reviewed by the CEO and board.

Simulation Dynamics:
Players (or the game’s AI) can simulate key decisions (such as scaling production, launching marketing campaigns, or investing in R&D) that will influence the financial, operational, and market metrics over time. This creates a dynamic environment where decisions made at the top cascade through the organization, affecting performance metrics that, in turn, influence future decisions.


## finalisation 2


Board of Directors (Top-Level)
User as the Main Investor & Board Member:

Role:
• Inputs the product name (e.g., “Jackfruit Delight”)
• Acts as the biggest investor in the game
• Sets initial high-level vision and strategy

In-Game Impact:
• Provides initial capital and key strategic direction
• Can trigger new initiatives if they choose to invest additional funds

NPC Board Directors (Long-Term Visionaries):

Role:
• Serve as co-visionaries who contribute ideas for product enhancements, expansion, or budget allocation
• If the main investor (user) does not provide a new idea or additional funding direction, these NPCs automatically generate ideas and set budgets based on pre-defined rules

In-Game Impact:
• Help determine long-term strategy and adjust budgets over time
• Influence key decisions that affect growth and innovation, acting as a balancing force with the user's input

Process Flow Example
Product Initiation:

The user enters the product name, which activates the board setup.

The user (main investor) is recognized as the lead board member.

Budget & Vision Setting:

The game assigns a starting budget based on the product category (product-based company).

NPC board directors review the user’s input:

If the user provides additional strategic input:
• NPCs adjust the budget allocation and roadmap based on that vision.

If no additional input is provided:
• The NPC board directors generate their own ideas (e.g., potential product enhancements or market expansion) and automatically set a revised budget.

Decision-Making & Feedback Loop:

The CEO (an NPC role within the simulation) receives the board’s directives and works with the executive team (CTO, CFO, etc.) to implement the product strategy.

As the simulation progresses, the board (both user and NPCs) reviews performance metrics (like daily revenue and balance sheets) and decides on adjustments (e.g., re-investing in R&D or launching new marketing campaigns).

Why This Structure?
User Empowerment:
The user, as the main investor, sets the product’s initial direction and feels directly involved in high-level decisions.

Dynamic Vision:
NPC board directors add a layer of long-term strategy and innovation. They ensure that if the user doesn’t provide additional input, the game still evolves by automatically generating ideas and managing budgets.

Balanced Decision Flow:
This design mimics real public companies where the board provides overarching guidance while delegating operational decisions to the executive team. In your simulation, the board’s decisions affect key simulation metrics (e.g., revenue, costs, growth) which then feed back into the strategic choices made by the CEO and executives.



## finalise 3

 Game Time and Scheduling
Time Conversion:
• Define 1 game day = 1 real hour.
• Use Unity’s Time.deltaTime along with a custom clock system to track days.

Daily Cycles:
• Divide the day into phases (e.g., Morning – Strategy Meetings, Afternoon – Operations, Evening – Review and Reflection).
• Schedule NPC dialogues and decisions to occur at different phases rather than all at once.

2. User Input and Initialization
User Input:
• At the start, the player enters the product name (e.g., “Jackfruit Delight”).
• This input becomes the foundation for the company’s identity and triggers the instantiation of the Board of Directors NPCs (with one being the main investor—the user).

Initialization of NPC Roles:
• The game creates the organizational hierarchy (Board, CEO, C-Suite, etc.) based on pre-defined templates for a product-based company.
• Each NPC is assigned responsibilities (e.g., CTO will lead tech-related discussions, CFO will focus on budgeting).

3. NPC Interaction & Dialogue System
Dialogue Trees & AI Integration:
• Use dialogue trees or AI systems (with LLaMA integration) to generate realistic, context-sensitive conversations among NPCs.
• Each NPC’s dialogue is based on their role and current simulation metrics (e.g., daily revenue, production levels).

Natural Conversation Flow:
• Build a conversation scheduler where each major meeting or decision-making event spans several in-game days.
• For example, “Day 1” might feature an initial meeting where the CEO outlines the vision, followed by follow-up discussions on strategy adjustments on subsequent days.

Simulated "Real-Time" Communication:
• NPC dialogues are not instant; use timers or coroutines to delay dialogue lines, mimicking natural conversation pacing.
• Incorporate cutscenes or dialogue logs where players can see long conversations and strategic debates unfolding over the day.

4. Decision-Making and Task Delegation
High-Level Meetings:
• The CEO meets with the C-Suite (CTO, CFO, etc.) in scheduled meetings (e.g., every “morning”) to discuss the new product’s strategy.
• Each executive then holds their own internal team meetings over the next in-game day or two.

Task Delegation:
• After the meeting, each executive assigns tasks to their respective senior leads.
• For instance, the CTO might direct senior tech leads to prototype features while the CFO assigns budgeting tasks to finance leads.

NPC Feedback Loop:
• At the end of each in-game day, a review meeting occurs where NPCs report progress (via dialogue logs and simulation metrics) to the CEO and Board.
• These meetings can influence strategic shifts, such as increased investment in R&D if production targets aren’t met.

5. Integration with Simulation Metrics
Key Simulation Metrics:
• Metrics like daily revenue, balance sheets, production output, and customer feedback are updated throughout the day.
• These metrics influence NPC decisions and dialogue—if daily revenue drops, the CFO may trigger a cost-control discussion.

Dynamic Adjustments:
• NPCs adjust strategies based on metric thresholds, and their conversations will reflect these shifts (e.g., “We need to cut costs” or “Let’s invest more in marketing”).

Visualization:
• Display real-time dashboards in the game (as part of the UI) so the player sees how decisions made by the board and executives affect the business over each simulated day.

6. Creating a Real-Life Pace
Pacing and Realism:
• Avoid instantaneous results; instead, simulate gradual progress. For example, changes in product quality or revenue may take several in-game days to materialize.
• Use narrative sequences where the game shows a "Day 1", "Day 2", etc., with reflective dialogue that highlights ongoing challenges and improvements.

Event-Based Progression:
• Certain events (like a product launch or a funding round) require multiple days of planning, discussion, and execution.
• This ensures the game feels like a living business, with realistic delays and gradual decision-making rather than rapid-fire computer responses.

Example Scenario: "Jackfruit Delight" Product Launch
Day 1:

User Input: Player names the product “Jackfruit Delight”.

Board Meeting: The main investor (user) and NPC board directors hold an initial meeting. The CEO outlines the vision.

Dialogue: NPCs discuss initial market research and decide on preliminary budget allocations.

Day 2-3:

C-Suite Meetings: CEO meets with CTO, CFO, and CMO.

CTO’s Team Formation: The CTO reaches out to senior tech leads to form a small product development team.

CFO’s Review: CFO engages senior finance leads to set up the financial model for production.

Dialogue: Conversations are paced over several in-game hours, reflecting realistic discussions and decision-making.

Day 4-5:

Operational Rollout: Teams start executing tasks. Production planning, marketing strategies, and financial forecasting are underway.

Metrics Update: Daily revenue and other KPIs are updated on a dashboard visible to the player.

Feedback Loop: A daily review meeting occurs where teams share progress, and the board reviews performance, triggering adjustments if needed.
